This is the new home of the 'Mavenized' jPOS Extended Edition.

While the code we place here is stable, the build process is still alpha and in flux.

For a stable version of jPOS-EE's modules, please see the HOWTO section at:

  http://jpos.org/doc/jPOS-Project-Guide.pdf

In order to build jPOS-EE, you need to 'mvn install' jPOS first.

Some tests use a local MySQL database called 'jposee_dev'. 

Make sure you:

  CREATE DATABASE jposee_dev;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON jposee_dev.* TO `jpos`@`localhost`;
