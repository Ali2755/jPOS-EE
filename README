This is the new home of the 'Mavenized' jPOS Extended Edition.

While the code we place here is stable, the build process is still alpha and in flux.

For a stable version of jPOS-EE's modules, please see the HOWTO section at:

  http://jpos.org/doc/jPOS-Project-Guide.pdf

In order to build jPOS-EE, you need to 'mvn install' jPOS first.
